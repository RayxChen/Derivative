#  Structural Patterns
How classes are composed to define more intricate structures. They allow us to design code that has extra functionality without having to rewrite existing code.

## 1. Adapter
The adapter is a class that translates an interface into a form that other classes
expect. It is most useful when we wish to fit code into a structure for which it was
not originally designed.

## 2. Bridge
The main difference between the bridge and the adapter is that the bridge is intended to define an intermediary interface from the start, whereas the adapter is introduced a later stage in order to solve incompatibilities

## 3.Decorator
The decorator patterns allows us to change the behaviour of a class at run-time
without changing its interface.
