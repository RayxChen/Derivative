#  Behavioural Patterns
Behavioural patterns are used for the implementation of algorithms. They allow
us to vary aspects of algorithms interchangeably. They can also allow us to re-use algorithms in wildly unrelated contexts.

## 1. Strategy
In the strategy pattern, we defer an important part of algorithm to an inputted
object. This allows us to easily change how this particular part of the algorithm behaves.
